<h1>To Do / Current Design Questions</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Store location and size (centerpoint relative to center of Univ,
      volume) of the Galactic Cluster on the database.
    <li>It must have a foreign key associating the GC with a UNIV.
    <li>Use that persisted data when computing the location of a new GC
      to make sure that it does not overlap with any existing GC.
    <li>Ask ChatGPT to help with collision algoriths for spheres
      and ellipsoids in a 3D space. It may be necessary to imagine
      both universe and cluster(s) as contained in rects? Not sure.
      Could make some math easier anyway!
    <li>Figuring this out will mean we can use similar logic when handling
      galaxies within the cluster, star systems within the galaxy and so on.
</ul>


<h1>Data Management</h1>

<h2>Data Persistence</h2>
    All values are stored as a 2-tuple where [0] = value and [1] = type
    of measurement unit, as defined by the SaskanMath() class.

    The type of object, i.e., what is being measured, is also identified
    via reference to a value defined in SaskanMath()'s "M" dataclass.

    Data stored in pickled format as a BLOB on sqlite3 database.

<h1>UniverseModel</h1>

<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<ul>
        <li>Use standard estimates for known universe,  with tweaks for variety.</li>
        <li>Pretend the Universe is a sphere, or a cartesian grid.</li>
        <li>N.B.: random.uniform() alway returns a float.</li>
        <li>Set radius in gigaparsecs</li>
        <li>Calculate volume in cubic gigaparsecs -> cubic gigalight years</li>
        <li>The estimated volume of the known universe is roughly 415000 GLY3.</li>
        So if I come up with a vol number somewhere in that ballpark, good.
        <li>The estimated total mass in kg is roughly 1.5e53 (1.5 × 10^53) kg</li>
        To come up with a mass in kg proportional to the volume, I'll find
        the difference between my randomized volume and the 'standard' volume
        and then apply that percentage to the 'standard' mass.
        Standard pcts are then applied to get dark energy, dark matter and
        baryonic matter.</li>
        <li>See SaskanMath() class C for astronomical unit conversions.
        SM.ASTRO.GPC_TO_GLY = gigaparsecs to gigalight years = 3.26156</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mass and Matter</h2>
    For the purposes of the game, we consider mass and matter to
    be the same thing. Antimatter equals matter at the big bang, but
    then almost entirely vanishes. No one knows why. Theoretically,
    the universe should not exist since matter and antimatter should
    have annihilated each other. But it does. So, we will assume that
    the universe is made of matter, not antimatter, and that the
    antimatter "went somewhere".

<h2>Shape of Universe</h2>
    For game purposes, the Total Universe is considered to be a sphere.
    The origin point at the center of the sphere is where this known
    universe began, its big bang point. Or in game terms, where the
    last game universe ended and a new one began.

<h2>Size of Universe</h2>
    Volume of known universe: 3.566 x 10^80 cubic meters
    Another estimate is 415,065 Glyr3  (cubic gigalight years).
    For game purposes, the size of the universe will randomly fluctuate
    around this value.

<h1>Galactic Cluster Model</h1>

<h2>Design Notes</h2>
- Set vector of galactic cluster center relative to TU center
in gigalightyears. The cluster can be located anywhere in
the universe, but should not reach beyond the 'edge' of
the (known) universe. For the purpose of this measurement, we
consider center of cluster as a Cartesian vector from center
of TU. To prevent it from reaching beyond the edge, we, limit
the vector to a length of 99% the radius of the universe. Since
the "widest" cluster is 10 parsecs, that is still much less than
1% of the radius of the universe.

- Compute a 3D ellipsoid size and shape for the galactic cluster,
centered around its location and measured in parsecs.
- A parsec is 3.2616 light years.
- A gigalightyear is 1 billion light years.
- So, even though galactic clusters are quite large, varying from
to 1 to 10 million parsecs, they are still tiny compared to the
total size of the universe. As such, we should expect that collisions
will be rare, but could still happen.
- So far, we have assumed that the cluster "disk" (ellipsoid) is flat
with respect to the universe's x/y grid. You could think of it like
our view of the cluster is always from "top down".
We have not yet considered pitch, yaw or roll, but we should.
- However, before "angling" the cluster, we can do the collision
detection at a very gross level, just by comparing the bounding
rectangles of the clusters. If they don't overlap, then we can
proceed. If they do overlap, then we can re-compute the location
and size.
- Verify that the cluster does not overlap with another cluster.


<h2>Location of Cluster</h2>
        Generate a random location vector (x, y, z) in megaparsecs
        locating the GC center as a random point within the TU
        in relation to the TU center (center of the universe)
        Ensure that x, y, and z are at least 2/3 of the TU radius.

<h2>Shape of Cluster</h2>
        Shaped like a thick flattened sphere, like a chubby pancake.
        A standard geometric formula for defining the shape of a
        flattened sphere can be based on the equation of an ellipsoid.
        An ellipsoid is a three-dimensional shape that can represent a
        flattened or stretched sphere. The formula for an ellipsoid is:
        frac{{x^2}}{{a^2}} + \frac{{y^2}}{{b^2}} + \frac{{z^2}}{{c^2}} = 1

        Where:
        - a represents the semi-major axis, controls extent along the x-axis.
        - b represents the semi-minor axis, controls extent along the y-axis.
        - c represents the semi-minor axis, controls extent along the z-axis.

        To create a flattened sphere shape, set a and b to equal each other
        but smaller (?) than c. This results in an ellipsoid that is flattened
        along one axis (z-axis) compared to a perfect sphere.

        Specific values of a, b, and c will determine exact shape and degree
        of flattening of the ellipsoid.  A typical value is for a, b and c
        to be 1/2 the value of x, y, and z respectively.

<h2>Collision Detection Between Clusters</h2>

- Define the bounding rectangle as a cube using the x dim. This will
give us the largest gross bounding rectangle. If the cluster is later
rotated, we have still accounted for the space it might take up.
- Convert parsecs to gigalightyears = parsecs / 3.086e19 before
computing. Size of clusters will be tiny compared to size of universe
but it is still theoretically possible to have a collision.
- The variation from center of cluster to edge of cluster is very small
delta compared to the center (x,y,z) coordinate. The significant
digits are in the 14th and 15th decimal places. For example, where
the x dim of the center is -39.1503867458995, the radius (delta)
on the order of 8.009487794162859e-14; so the left, right edges of
the bounding rectangle on x axis would be (-39.15038674589958,
-39.150386745899425). The difference between the two is 1.53e-13.
- For display purposes, might want to convert from GLY to MLY (x 1000)
or even lightyears (x 1_000_000_000_000_000, that is, x 10e14)?
Nah. That actually obscures the problem.


<h2>Rotation of 3D objects</h2>

Rolling, rotating, and reorienting a 3D ellipsoid (or any 3D object) involves a concept similar to the aviation terms of "pitch," "yaw," and "roll," but the terminology may vary in different contexts. Here's how you can express these rotations and what units are commonly used:

1. **Pitch**: Pitch rotation typically refers to the rotation around the horizontal (X) axis. In aviation, this is commonly associated with tilting the nose of an aircraft up or down. The unit of measure can be degrees or radians. Both degrees and radians are widely used, and the choice often depends on the specific application or library you're using. In Python, libraries like NumPy and most 3D libraries support rotations in both degrees and radians.

2. **Yaw**: Yaw rotation involves the rotation around the vertical (Y) axis. This is like turning left or right. Again, degrees or radians can be used for measurement.

3. **Roll**: Roll rotation is around the depth (Z) axis. This is similar to tilting to the side. Degrees or radians can be used here as well.

The choice of degrees or radians depends on the library or framework you're using and your personal preference. Radians are often preferred in mathematical and computational contexts due to their mathematical properties, but degrees are more commonly used in everyday discussions.

In terms of expressing these rotations in 3D, you typically use rotation matrices or quaternions to represent the orientation of the ellipsoid after rotation. The specific mathematics and notation may vary depending on the libraries you're using. For example, in Python, libraries like NumPy provide functions for performing 3D rotations.

Here's a general idea of how you might perform these rotations:

- Pitch (X-axis rotation):
  ```python
  from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R
  r = R.from_euler('x', angle, degrees=True)  # Rotate by 'angle' degrees around X-axis
  new_orientation = r.apply(original_orientation)
  ```

- Yaw (Y-axis rotation):
  ```python
  r = R.from_euler('y', angle, degrees=True)  # Rotate by 'angle' degrees around Y-axis
  new_orientation = r.apply(original_orientation)
  ```

- Roll (Z-axis rotation):
  ```python
  r = R.from_euler('z', angle, degrees=True)  # Rotate by 'angle' degrees around Z-axis
  new_orientation = r.apply(original_orientation)
  ```

The key is to use a library that provides these rotation functions and to be consistent with your choice of degrees or radians for the rotation angles.


The direction of rotation, whether it's "up" or "down," "left" or "right," is expressed through the sign (positive or negative) of the rotation angle. The convention for specifying the direction of rotation around an axis, such as pitch, yaw, or roll, is as follows:

1. Positive rotation: This corresponds to rotating in the "counter-clockwise" or "anticlockwise" direction when viewing the rotation axis from the positive end. For example, if you're looking along the positive X-axis and you want to pitch "up," you'd use a positive angle.

2. Negative rotation: This corresponds to rotating in the "clockwise" direction when viewing the rotation axis from the positive end. If you want to pitch "down," you'd use a negative angle.

The choice of the sign (positive or negative) depends on your coordinate system and the specific library or mathematical convention you're following. In many standard 3D libraries and systems, the positive direction for pitch, yaw, and roll follows the "right-hand rule," which is a widely accepted convention in mathematics and physics.

- In the right-hand rule, when you point your right thumb in the positive direction of the rotation axis (e.g., the X-axis for pitch), the fingers of your right hand curl in the positive (counter-clockwise) direction of rotation.

- For pitch, positive rotation tilts "up" when looking along the positive X-axis (right thumb points in the direction of positive X-axis).

- For yaw, positive rotation turns to the "right" when looking along the positive Y-axis (right thumb points in the direction of positive Y-axis).

- For roll, positive rotation tilts to the "right" when looking along the positive Z-axis (right thumb points in the direction of positive Z-axis).

It's essential to maintain consistency in the sign of rotation angles to correctly specify the desired direction of rotation in your specific system or library.


<h2>Volume of Cluster</h2>

         The formula for the volume (V) of a 3D ellipsoid with semi-axes lengths a, b, and c is given by:

          V = 4/3 x π x a x bx c

<h2>Visualization of Cluster</h2>
        Eventually, maybe use Blender. Get a better sense of the shape of
        the ellipsoid by plotting and visualizing it in three dimensions. I am
        not yet 100% sure that I am defining the ellipsoid shapes correctly.

        Break each calculation into a method. If it seems they could have an
        abstract use, try to parameterize appropriately. For very common
        formulas (distance, volume, etc) move them into saskan_math.

        - Consider trying a 2D visualization rather then going down the
          rabbit hole of a 3D visualization? See viz_lab for some starting
          points using matplotlib. Processing might also be an option for
          simpler visualizations.
        - Also see:
          https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/shapes_and_collections/ellipse_demo.html
           and
          https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/shapes_and_collections/ellipse_collection.html
        - Should be able to have some simple fun with those. Can probably do
          something similar in PyGame for that matter.

<h1>Timing Pulsar</h1>

<h2>Location of Pulsar</h2>
        Compute a location within the GC that is
        a random distance from the GC center but
        relatively close (inner 1/3rd of the ellipsoid)
        to the core/center of the galactic cluster.
        Cluster shape is ellipsoid, not a sphere; so
        calculuation is more complex than just using
        one radius value.

<h2>Atomic Clock</h2>
        cesium-133 vibrates exactly 9,192,631,770 times per second.
        That is a meausre of frequency which could be reproduced
        anywhere in the universe. But it is still culturally-bound in
        that the second itself is derived from the planet Earth's
        relationship to it Sun. This type of time measure is referred
        to as an atomic clock.
        To be more precise, an atomic second related to the unperturbed
        ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom.

<h2>Pulsar Clock</h2>
        Meausuring the rate of pulsar pulses is also very reliable,
        and is the basis for some navigation systems. Not all pulsars
        have the same frequency, but they are all very regular.
        See: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-017-0459-0

        Although observing and correctly measuring the frequency of the
        pulses of a pulsar is technolgically complex, it is very accurate
        and has been proposed as a superior method of timekeeping for
        autonomous spacecraft navigation.  A reference location (that is,
        a particular mature rotation-based pulsar) must be selected.
        This could be the basis for a universal time standard,
        a "galactic clock" that is used, in the game context, by the Agency.

<h2>Galactic Lighthouse</h2>
        A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits
        beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles.
        Sort of like a galatic lighthouse. The periods range from
        milliseconds to seconds.  The fastest known pulsar, PSR J1748-2446ad,
        rotates 716 times per second, so its period is 1.4 milliseconds.
        Pulsars can be more accurate, consistent than atomic clocks.

        For the game purposes, we'll define the pulsar rate as close to
        716 times per second.

        The idea for the game is to make up a pulsar llike PSR J1748-2446ad,
        assign it a very regular period, and use it as a universal time
        in reference to all other units.

<h2>Time Dilation</h2>
        Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when a reference
        frame is moving relative to another reference frame. In the
        case of very fast travel, especially near the speed of light,
        time itself will slow down for the traveler. Also, space-time
        is curved in gravity wells like solar systems. This will need
        to be accounted for if interstellar travel and/or near-light-speed
        or (so-called) warp speed travel is allowed in the game.
